\begin{itemize}
  \item<1->Is there an upper bound on the zombie-number for planar graphs?
  \item<2->Is there an upper bound on the zombie-number of outerplanar graphs?
  \item<3->What about cycles with more than one chord?
  \item<4->Can the proof strategy employed for $Q_{m,n}$ be generalized to any two cycles with shared path? Or bowtie graphs?
\end{itemize}
\note<1>[item]{In Chapter 2, we showed the existence of a graph for which 3 zombies always lose.}
\note<2>[item]{In Chapter 3, we show how to win as two zombies on a cycle with one chord.}
