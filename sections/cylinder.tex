The Cylinder graph $C_{m,n}$ is a rectangular arrangement of $mn$ vertices in
$m$ rows and $n$ columns much like the Grid, except that vertices on one
boundary edge are joined to vertices on the opposite side.

Note that this a planar graph for any $m$ and $n$. Again, cylinder graph can be constructed by taking the
Cartesian product of a cycle and a path $C_m \square P_n$.

We claim now that three zombies suffice to win on this family of graphs since they can execute
a guarding strategy similar to the one detailed in the previous section.
