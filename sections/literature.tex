We start with some key results from Cops and Robbers since much of our thesis is comparison
between the two games. Or \textit{the cost of being undead} as Fitzpatrick \cite{fitzpatrick2016deterministic} would call it.

\subsection{Cops and Robbers, Cop-Number}

Study of vertex pursuit games is first attributed to Quilliot \cite{quilliot1978jeux, quilliot1983problemes}, and Nowakowski and Winkler \cite{nowakowski1983vertex}.
Both authors independently consider games of Cops and Robbers with a single Cop and characterize by way of a relation those graphs where the Cop always wins. These are now known as Cop-win graphs
and can be recognized by the existence of an ordering of the vertices called a \textit{dismantling};
so-called because it is the successive deletion of \textit{corners} resulting in a single vertex
(see the last section on dismantlings, cop-win trees and visiblity graphs ).

The Cop-number of a graph (denoted $c(G)$) is introduced by Aigner and Fromme in \cite{aigner1984game}) and defined as the minimum number of Cops required
to guarantee a Cop win on a graph $G$. Later, \cite{berarducci1993cop} and \cite{hahn2003characterisation} generalized the idea of cop-win graphs
into $k$-copwin graphs.

A graph is $k$-cop win if and only if there exists a function (on a $k$-product of the graph to represent the position of the Cops)
which satisfies certain properties; essentially it is a function which takes as input a position $C$ of Cops and returns the next position for the Cops that guarantees a win (see \cite{bonato2011game}[p. 119]).
There exists a polynomial-time algorithm for deciding whether a graph is $k$-Cop-win by iteratively
solving for this function.

Another important line of inquiry relating to the Cop-number is the investigation of Meyniel's conjecture, which posits that $\bigO(\sqrt{n})$ is an upper bound on the Cop-number \cite{frankl1987cops}.
Incremental progress has been made on special classes of graphs as well as for graphs in general. See also for a recent
overview \cite{gera2016graph}[p. 31].

\subsection{The Cop-Number and the Genus of the Graph}

One of the most surprising results about the Game of Cops and Robbers is owed to Aigner and Fromme \cite{aigner1984game}, who showed that the cop number of a planar graph is at most 3.
Basically, a graph is planar if it can be drawn in the plane (say, on a piece of paper) without crossing any edges. Aigner and Fromme describe a 3-Cop strategy which uses \textit{isometric} paths of the graph to encircle and entrap the Robber.

Outerplanar graphs are planar graphs which can be drawn such that all vertices belong to the outer face. Clarker \cite{clarke2002constrained} showed that the cop number of outerplanar graphs is 2 by considering
two possible cases: those with and without cut vertices. The 2 Cops have a winning strategy on outerplanar graphs without cut vertices, and this strategy can be used to cordon off sections (blocks)
of the outerplanar graph.

The game has also been studied for graphs embeddable in surfaces of higher order.
In 2001, Schroeder conjectured \cite{bonato2017topological} that for a graph of genus $g$,
the cop-number is at most $g+3$.

\subsection{Relation to the Girth and Minimum Degree of a Graph}

Aigner and Fromme also show a relationship between the Cop-number, the girth of a graph and
its minimum degree \cite{aigner1984game}. More precisely, if $G$ has girth at least 5, then $c(G)\geq \delta(G)$ where $\delta(G)$ is the minimum degree of $G$.

This result has since been refined by \cite{frankl1987cops} and again recently in a
seminar by B. Mohar.

\subsection{Dismantlings, Cop-win Trees, Zombie-win Trees}

Quilliot and Nowakowski both indepedently characterized cop-win graphs as those which
admit a \textit{dismantling}.

A (one-point) retract is an edge preserving function $f : G \mapsto H = G \setminus v$
(aka a homomorphism) such that $f(v) = x$ for some $x \neq v \in V(G)$ and $f$ restricted on $H$ is the identity.
Formally,

\[ f(v) = x \qquad f(u) = u \qquad \forall u \in V(G)\setminus \{ v \} \]

and
\[ xy \in E(G) \implies f(x)f(y) \in E(G \setminus \{ v \}) \]

If $G$ is a reflexive graph, then a one-point retract can be seen as joining
two vertices. The edge between two adjacent vertices becomes another loop.
The retract maps a graph $G$ to graph $G'$ with one less vertex.

Recall that corners are vertices $v$ whose closed neighbourhoods
are a subset of a neighbours' closed neighbourhood, i.e.

\[u,v\in V(G) \qquad \text{and} \qquad N[v] \subseteq N[u] \]

You can define a retract on corner $v$: if $v$ is a corner, then it is
dominated by some $u \in V(G)$. So if $x \in V(G)$, $x \neq v$ and
$xv \in E(G)$ then $xu \in E(G)$ by definition of a corner. Therefore the map

\[ f(x) = \begin{cases}
u & \text{if } x = v \\
x & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases} \]

is edge preserving since $f(x)f(v) = xu$ and $xu \in E(G)$, so $xu \in E(H) = E(G - v)$.
For other vertices $x,y \not\in \{u,v\}$, $f(x)f(y) = xy \in E(G)$ so $f(x)f(y) \in E(G- v)$ also.
This shows that $f$ is a homomorphism as required and hence a retract.

This is a formal way of saying that a corner of a graph can be folded into a
dominating vertex: an astute Robber would never move into a corner.

A dismantling is a sequence of retracts $f_1, f_2, \dots, f_{n-1}$ such that the
composition $F_{n-1} = f_{n-1} \circ f_{n-2} \circ \cdots f_2 \circ f_1$ gives a
function for which $F_{n-1} (G) = K_1$. That is, there is a sequence of retracts
which maps the graph to a single vertex.

Not all vertices of a graph need be corners in order for there
to exist a dismantling: it suffices to have an ordering where each $v_i$ is a corner in
$G[v_i, v_{i+1}, \dots, v_n]$.

Such a sequence of $f_j$'s defines a copwin ordering
\[ \mathcal{O} = \{ v_1, v_2, \dots, v_n\} \]
 where $v_1$ is a corner in $G_1 = G$, $v_2$ is a corner in $G - v_1$, and so on.

A fundamental result in C \& R is that copwin graphs -- graphs for which a single
cop is guaranteed to win --  are characterized by the existence of such dismantlings.
A graph is copwin if and only if it is dismantlable.


A Cop-win spanning tree combines the idea of a dismantling with a spanning tree
and was first proposed in \cite{clarke2002constrained}.

A copwin spanning tree $S$ is defined as a tree where $x,y\in V(G)$
$xy \in E(S)$ if there exists a retract $f_j$ in the dismantling
$F_n = f_{n} \circ f_{n-1} \circ \cdots \circ f_{2} \circ f_1$
such that $f_j (x) = y$ or $f_j (y) = x$ in $G[j]$.

Copwin spanning trees give a strategy for the cops to follow: start at the root
(the last vertex in the ordering) and descend the tree in the branch containing the robber.
Lemmas 2.1.2 and 2.1.3 from \cite{clarke2002constrained} show that the cop
can always stay in the same branch (and above) the robber in the tree. So the
robber is eventually stuck in a leaf and caught.

\subsection{Deterministic Zombies}

Zombies and Survivors (or more specifically, ``deterministic zombies'') are an interesting variation proposed in \cite{fitzpatrick2016deterministic}. In these games, the
Cops are replaced by Zombies which must follow a geodesic to the Survivor.

The Zombie Number is defined analogously to the Cop Number: it is the number of Zombies
required to capture the Survivor. However, in Z \& S there are two additional considerations:
the zombie start and the zombie choices.
In this type of game, the starting locations for the zombies is of utmost importance:
consider how difficult it might be to evade adversaries which are clustered versus some
that are well-dispersed. So we say $z(G) = k$ if $k$ zombies are guaranteed to win
given an appropriate (or optimal) start. Additionally, the rules of this game permit
some agency to the zombies: when confronted with multiple geodesics, they may have
a choice between neighbouring vertices. Zombie number also presumes that
the zombies make the correct choices. Perhaps more precisely, the zombie number of a
graph is $k$ if $k$ zombies, suitably positioned, can play a game which guarantees the survivor
is caught.

Unlike Cops, these Zombies cannot apply a cornering strategy. Or any strategy.
As a consequence, you need at least as many Zombies as you need Cops.
This is one of the first observations
in \cite{fitzpatrick2016deterministic}: the Cop Number $c(G)$ is a lower bound of the Zombie Number. The Zombies are weaker versions of Cops, similar in a way to the ``fully active'' Cops from \cite{gromovikov2018fully} where the Cops must move on their turn. Both
active and ``lazy'' Cops have more freedom of choice than the zombies, and thus
fewer are required to ensure victory.

Does a characterization exist for Zombie-win graphs? Those for which a single zombie
can always win? One has yet to be described. Howeover, \cite{fitzpatrick2016deterministic} showed that a graph is zombie-win if a specific spanning tree exists:

\begin{theorem}[Fitzpatrick] If there exists a breadth-first search of a graph $G$ such that the associated spanning tree is also a cop-win spanning tree, then G is zombie-win.
\end{theorem}

Thus a sufficient condition for zombie-win graphs are those for which a specific copwin tree exists: one equivalent to a breadth-first search of the graph from some vertex. It remains unclear if it is also a necessary condition.

A few questions: are copwin graphs necessarily zombie win? No. Smallest counter example is also
found by \cite{fitzpatrick2016deterministic} and is reproduced below \ref{fig:copwin_but_notzombie_win}
What is the dismantling of this copwin but not-zombie win graph. Since a dismantling exists,
a copwin spanning tree exists.

\includegraphics[scale=0.50]{copwin_tree/copwin_but_notzombie_win}
\caption{Cop-Win but not Zombie-Win \label{fig:copwin_but_notzombie_win}}
\end{figure}

Below \ref{fig:copwin_tree_example1} is an example of a graph and two dismantlings, one of which results in a BFS tree, and the other does not.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.70]{copwin_tree/copwin_tree_example1}
\caption{A Cop-win tree \label{fig:copwin_tree_example1}}
\end{figure}

Here are two dismantlings, their orderings, and the resulting copwin spanning trees.
\begin{align*}
  f_1(b) = f \\
  f_2(c) = d \\
  f_3(f) = e \\
  f_4(a) = e \\
  f_5(e) = g \\
  f_6(d) = g
\end{align*}

Gives ordering $\mathcal{O}_1 = \{ b, c, f, a, e, d, g \}$. Whereas

\begin{align*}
  g_1(b) = f \\
  g_2(a) = e \\
  g_3(c) = d \\
  g_4(f) = d \\
  g_5(e) = d \\
  g_6(g) = d
\end{align*}

Also gives a dismantling with ordering $\mathcal{O}_2 = \{b, a, c, f, e, g, d \}$.
But only the second produces a copwin tree obtainable as a bread-first search.

\begin{figure}[h!]

\includegraphics[scale=0.70]{copwin_tree/copwin_tree_example1_trees}
\end{figure}

Moreover, it would seem that a zombie loses if it starts on $g$, but not on $d$.


\subsection{Probabilistic zombies}

Zombies are often depicted as mindless or aimless. It is a common trope that zombies
idle around, moving in random directions until they somehow (suddenly) distinguish
the uninfected. It is only at this point that the zombies will charge.

Such behavior likely inspired another type of pursuit game \cite{bonato2016probabilistic} in which the zombies start randomly on
the graph. Once the survivor chooses a start vertex, the zombies ``notice'' the survivor and start
moving directly towards it.

Without knowing where the zombies start, however, it is impossible to know the outcome with certainty.
So study of these games becomes probabilistic; zombies win if they have at least a 50\% chance of winning.
The (probabilistic) zombie number of a graph is the number of zombies required for a 50\% chance of winning and this zombie number is
obtained for several classes of graphs in \cite{bonato2016probabilistic} and for
toroidal grids in \cite{pralat2019many}.
