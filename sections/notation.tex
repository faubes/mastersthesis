The following sections will use a few basic ideas and definitions from graph theory.
Formally, a graph $G = (V, E)$ is composed of:

\begin{itemize}
\item A set $V$ of vertices.
\item A set $E \subset V \times V$ of edges described by a pair of endpoints.
\end{itemize}

If $G = (V,E)$ is a graph and $x,y \in V$ are vertices, we say that vertices $x$ and $y$ are neighbours if $(x,y) \in E$.
That is, if there is an edge joining $x$ to $y$.
In these games, the edges are assumed to be undirected and so we may write $xy = yx$
and consider the two directions as a single edge.
We call the set of all neighbours of $x$ the neighbourhood of $x$ which we denote $N(x) \subset V$.

[Need to add degree, subgraph, paths,  distance, diameter]

For example, in Figure 1 we have vertices $V = \{ 000, 001, 010, 011, 100, 101, 110, 111 \}$.
Since $000$ and $001$ are connected, $(000, 001) \in E$.
The neighbourhood of $000$ is $N(000) = \{ 001, 010, 100 \}$.

\subsection{Modeling the Game}

We need a way to identify the players' positions over time so let
$z_t^i \in V(G)$ be zombie $i$ on round $t$. Similarly $s_t$ is the
survivor on round $t$. It might be tempting to group the zombies together
into some tuple of the vertex set, but each zombie acts independently of
the others and so this may not always be practical.

We typically use only one survivor, so we normally only use a few zombies, and
say $i \in \{1, \dots, k\}$ for ``small'' values of $k$.

Indeed, in some cases a single zombie may suffice
to capture the survivor. (We examine this scenario in the next section.)

The zombies play, then the survivor plays and these two turns make one round.
In particular, when we start the game we allow $z_0 \in V(G)$ to be
 any vertex of the graph.

\subsection{Paths and Moves}
The zombie strategy requires that we consider the shortest path towards the survivor.

In these games we use graph distance (or, equivalently, assume the edges have unit cost).
In other words, the distance between two vertices is the hop length of a (shortest possible) path
connecting them.
(EDIT: The existence and nature of shortest path may warrant further discussion, in lemmas \& observations below.)

Moreover, you may have many possible paths but from a player's perspective only the
next move really matters. Each zombie must choose $z_{i+1} \in N(z_i)$ such that
the distance $d(z_i, s_i)$ is reduced. We call all the set of all neighbours on
a shortest path to the survivor the \textit{zombie moves}.

\subsection{Rounds and Turns}
You could say that the game starts on round 0 with the zombies choosing their
start locations. The survivor then also picks. Then round 1 begins with the
zombies finding, selecting and moving along a shortest path. In some cases the survivor
may forfeit immediately. This is normal. If the graph is too simple
then the game is not very interesting.

The players choose start vertices in round 0, and that round 1
begins with the zombies considering their approach.


\subsection{Zombie Number}

EDIT: Not quite. Redo

The minimum number zombies guaranteed to win.

If a single zombie is guaranteed to win on a graph, we say that it is zombie-win
and that it has zombie number $z(G) = 1$. If it can be shown that $k$ zombies win,
then $z(G) = k$
