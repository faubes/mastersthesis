\subsection{How to Play Zombies and Survivor}

Zombies and Survivor is similar to C \& R except that zombies move
``directly'' toward the survivor. More precisely, on the zombies' turn
each zombie independently selects a shortest path toward the survivor (a \textit{geodesic})
and moves along the edge to the next vertex of the path.

The sophistication of the zombies' strategy gives them their name:
you can imagine the zombies -- arms outstretched -- ambling directly towards the survivor.
As in C \& R, the players have complete information of the graph and the positions of the players. Indeed, the zombies need to know the position of the survivor to enact
their strategy.

If uncaught, the survivor may move to one of its neighbouring vertices or stay in place.
 Again, a move is an instantaneous jump along an edge from one vertex to another.

The game concludes when either:
\begin{itemize}
\item A zombie eats the survivor by moving to the survivor's vertex.
\item The survivor evades the zombies indefinitely.
\end{itemize}

%It is easy to determine that a zombie has won. It is perhaps not as obvious how
%to determine the latter. We discuss winning conditions in greater detail in Section~\ref{}.

%The Z \& S games studied herein use a few zombies chasing a single survivor. The game
%can be adapted to multiple survivors by making the zombies move toward
%to the closest. We focus on games with a single survivor.

\subsection{Modeling the Game}

We call $s \in V(G)$ the survivor and $z_i \in V(G)$ are zombies with $i \in \{1, \dots, k\}$.
This notation represents both a player and its position in the graph.
In the games studied there is a single survivor and $k \geq 1$ of zombies.


We divide the game into rounds and turns. A round consists of two turns:
a zombie turn and a survivor turn.
It is convenient to define the zombie's turn on $t \equiv 0 \mod{2}$ and the survivor's turn on $t \equiv 1 \mod{2}$.
Round $r$ is given by $\lfloor \frac{t}{2} \rfloor$.

It is occasionally useful to identify the players' positions over time, in which
case let $z_r^i \in V(G)$ be zombie $i$ on round $r$. Similarly $s_r$ is the
survivor on round $r$. This burdensome notation will be omitted when possible.

It might be tempting to group the zombies together
into some tuple of the vertex set, but each zombie acts independently of
the others and so this may not be practical.

\subsection{Paths and Moves}
The zombie strategy requires consideration of all geodesics connecting
each zombie to the survivor. Let us be precisely define these terms.
%In the studied discrete graphs below, the distance between two vertices is the hop length of a %(shortest possible) path connecting them.


Consider zombie $k$. According to the rules of the game, on its turn the zombie
``must move on a shortest path'' towards the survivor. The \textit{zombie moves}
are those neighbours which lie on a shortest path toward the survivor, and which could be denoted

\[ Z[x, s] = \{ y \in N(x) \mid d(y, s) = d(x, s) - 1 \} \]

the zombies moves from $x$ given survivor is on $s$.


[fix me here; simplify; clarify]

There is at least one such move since our graph is presumed connected,
so $i > 0$ and $Z_k \neq \emptyset$.

If there is only one path, then $z_k$'s next move is $u_{i, 1}$. If all $zs$-paths
include $u_{i,1}$, then again $z_k$'s next move must be to that vertex.

If, however, there are multiple $zs$-paths which have different first moves,
then the zombie could make multiple moves.


\subsection{Deterministic Zombies}

Zombies and Survivors (or more specifically, ``deterministic zombies'') are an interesting variation proposed in \cite{fitzpatrick2016deterministic}. In these games, the
Cops are replaced by Zombies which must follow a geodesic to the Survivor.

The Zombie Number is defined analogously to the Cop Number: it is the number of Zombies
required to capture the Survivor. However, in Z \& S there are two additional considerations:
the zombie start and the zombie choices.
In this type of game, the starting locations for the zombies is of utmost importance:
consider how difficult it might be to evade adversaries which are clustered versus some
that are well-dispersed. So we say $z(G) = k$ if $k$ is the minimum number of
zombies required to guaranteed a win
given an appropriate (or optimal) start. Additionally, the rules of this game permit
some agency to the zombies: when confronted with multiple geodesics, they may have
a choice between neighbouring vertices. Zombie number also presumes that
the zombies make the correct choices. Perhaps more precisely, the zombie number of a
graph is $k$ if $k$ zombies, suitably positioned, can play a game which guarantees the survivor
is caught.

Unlike Cops, these Zombies cannot apply a cornering strategy. Or any strategy.
As a consequence, you need at least as many Zombies as you need Cops.
This is one of the first observations
in \cite{fitzpatrick2016deterministic}: the Cop Number $c(G)$ is a lower bound of the Zombie Number. The Zombies are weaker versions of Cops, similar in a way to the ``fully active'' Cops from \cite{gromovikov2018fully} where the Cops must move on their turn. Both
active and ``lazy'' Cops have more freedom of choice than the zombies, and thus
fewer are required to ensure victory.

Does a characterization exist for Zombie-win graphs? Those for which a single zombie
can always win? One has yet to be described. Howeover, \cite{fitzpatrick2016deterministic} showed that a graph is zombie-win if a specific spanning tree exists:

\begin{theorem}[Fitzpatrick] If there exists a breadth-first search of a graph $G$ such that the associated spanning tree is also a cop-win spanning tree, then G is zombie-win.
\end{theorem}

Thus a sufficient condition for zombie-win graphs are those for which a specific copwin tree exists: one equivalent to a breadth-first search of the graph from some vertex. It is unknown if it is also a necessary condition.

A few questions: are cop-win graphs necessarily zombie-win? No. A counter example \cite{fitzpatrick2016deterministic} is reproduced below \ref{fig:copwin_but_notzombie_win}.
%What is the dismantling of this cop-win but not-zombie win graph. Since a dismantling exists,
%a cop-win spanning tree exists.

\caption{Cop-Win but not Zombie-Win \label{fig:copwin_but_notzombie_win}}
\end{figure}

Below \ref{fig:copwin_tree_example1} is an example of a graph and two dismantlings, one of which results in a BFS tree, and the other does not.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.70]{copwin_tree/copwin_tree_example1}
\caption{A Cop-win tree \label{fig:copwin_tree_example1}}
\end{figure}

Here are two dismantlings, their orderings, and the resulting copwin spanning trees.
\begin{align*}
  f_1(b) = f \\
  f_2(c) = d \\
  f_3(f) = e \\
  f_4(a) = e \\
  f_5(e) = g \\
  f_6(d) = g
\end{align*}

Gives ordering $\mathcal{O}_1 = \{ b, c, f, a, e, d, g \}$. Whereas

\begin{align*}
  g_1(b) = f \\
  g_2(a) = e \\
  g_3(c) = d \\
  g_4(f) = d \\
  g_5(e) = d \\
  g_6(g) = d
\end{align*}

Also gives a dismantling with ordering $\mathcal{O}_2 = \{b, a, c, f, e, g, d \}$.
But only the second produces a copwin tree obtainable as a bread-first search.

\begin{figure}[h!]

\end{figure}

Moreover, it would seem that a zombie loses if it starts on $g$, but not on $d$.


\subsection{Probabilistic zombies}

Zombies are often depicted as mindless or aimless. It is a common trope that zombies
idle around, moving in random directions until they somehow (suddenly) distinguish
the uninfected. It is only at this point that the zombies will charge.

Such behavior likely inspired another type of pursuit game \cite{bonato2016probabilistic} in which the zombies start randomly on
the graph. Once the survivor chooses a start vertex, the zombies ``notice'' the survivor and start
moving directly towards it (again by following a shortest path).

Without knowing where the zombies start, however, it is impossible to know the outcome with certainty.
So study of these games becomes probabilistic; zombies win if they have at least a 50\% chance of winning.
The (probabilistic) zombie number of a graph is the minimum number of zombies required for a 50\% chance of winning and this zombie number is
obtained for several classes of graphs in \cite{bonato2016probabilistic} and for
toroidal grids in \cite{pralat2019many}.

The original paper on probabilistic zombies \cite{bonato2016probabilistic} also includes a lemma which is useful for our work
in Chapters~\ref{chapter planar zombies} and \ref{chapter q_m_n}:

\begin{lemma}[3.1, \cite{bonato2016probabilistic}] The survivor wins on $C_n$ against $k \geq 2$ zombies if and only if all zombies are initially located on an induced subpath
containing at most $\lceil\frac{n}{2}\rceil-2$ vertices.
\end{lemma}
