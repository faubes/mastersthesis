The zombies win if they manage to move onto the vertex occupied by the survivor. That's fairly obvious. 
However, in the section How to Play ZAS, we also said that the game was won by the survivor ``when it becomes obvious that the survivor will not be caught.''

If played on a finite graph, this necessarily means that the survivor has managed to lead
the zombies into a cycle.
