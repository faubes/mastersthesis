\subsection{Keep Your Distance}

  Consider an arbitrary zombie $z_r$ at round $r$.
  We know
  \[d(z_r, s_r) \leq \text{diam}(G) \]
  Moreover, for all $r \geq 1$ the sequence $d(z_r, s_r)$ of distances is non-inceasing, i.e.,
  \[ d(z_{r+1}, s_{r+1}) \leq d(z_r, s_r)\]

\begin{proof}
The first part follows from the definition of the diameter of the graph.

If $z_i = s_i$, then $d(z_i, s_i) = 0$ and the game is over. We may consider the
game to be finished (and the sequence thus finite and non-increasing)
or suppose that the zombie mirrors the survivor forever and thereby obtain a sequence
of zeroes (which is non-increasing).

Otherwise, we have $z_i \not= s_i$ and, since $G$ is connected, there exists a shortest $z_is_i$-path. Say

EDIT: reverse order so that $u_1$ is next move?

\[ P : z_i = u_0, u_1, \dots, u_k = s_i \]

so that $d(z_i, s_i) = k$.

On round $i+1$, the zombie must move to $z_{i+1} \in N(z_i)$ such that $d(z_{i+1}, s_i) < d(z_i, s_i)$.
In fact, in the graph distance model we have precisely $d(z_{i+1}, s_i) = d(z_i, s_i) - 1$.
We can suppose that $z_{i+1} = u_1$ is the next vertex along $P$.

In response, the survivor moves to $s_{i+1} \in N[s_i]$. Then

\[ P' : z_{i+1} = u_1, u_2, \dots, u_k, s_{i+1} \]

is a $z_{i+1}s_{i+1}$-path of length at most $k$. So the length of a shortest zombie-survivor
path on round $i+1$ is at most $k = d_i$. So $d_{i+1} \leq d_i$.
\end{proof}

Now, can we tell which are the graphs for which a single zombie is guaranteed to capture the
survivor?

It is pretty clear that the survivor has little chance if the graph is a
a simple path $P_n$.
Indeed, any finite acyclic graph is zombie win since an acyclic and connected graph
has a unique path connecting any $z, s \in V(T)$. Every step the zombie takes towards
the survivor limits the survivor's movement.
