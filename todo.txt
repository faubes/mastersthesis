Check Delta for m = n-1, m = n-2, m = n-3


Review Cop-Win Tree and Zombie-Win BFS Tree. Is the triangular grid zombie win?

If a graph is zombie-win, there must exist a BFS copwin tree?


Review characterization of cop number n graphs -- can notion of BFS trees be extended to this form?

Minmax principle: if a survivor can force the zombies to return to a previous configuration, then s wins.


Single File Lemma

Rework proofs to add clarity re: rounds vs. turns.

What is the zombie number of a triangulation?

Cycle with two chords?

Review cop number outerplanar is 2. Can proof strategy / graph structure be applied to zombie proof?

Remove subsections in Notation and Lemmas

Add planar graph with zombie number > 3 in Observations

Distance between players is taken at the beginning (or end) of a round: that is when
the zombies must calculate their next move. The end of round $i$ is the beginning of
round i+1. You could say the distance at round 0 is infinite, since they have not yet
chosen a position.

Clarify notation z^i_r as position of player begining of round r >= 1. R for round.

Add new declaration for Diameter operator of graph.

Can a survivor cause oscillation? Zombie and survivor hop back and forth
between two vertices indefinitely.

A zombie cannot stay in place. It must move.

Add zombie-win start positions to definitions.

Q_m_n

Q_m,n for small m, n.

Conjecture on upper and lower bounds of Delta

Prove said conjecture

Modify code to remove values of delta which will not permit offset for general zombie start

Find all possible zombie positions where $z_2$ starts on smaller cycle.

Run Floyd-Warshall on torus grid.

Recurse backwards from "zombie loss" positions to find all losing zombie positions
