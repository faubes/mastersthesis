Review Cop-Win Tree and Zombie-Win BFS Tree. Is the triangular grid zombie win?

Review characterization of cop number n graphs -- can notion of BFS trees be extended to this form?

Minmax principle: if a survivor can force the zombies to return to a previous configuration, then s wins.

Q_m,n for small m, n.

Single File Lemma

Rework proofs to add clarity re: rounds vs. turns.

What is the zombie number of a triangulation?

Cycle with two chords?

Review cop number outerplanar is 2. Can proof strategy / graph structure be applied to zombie proof?

Remove subsections in Notation and Lemmas

Add planar graph with zombie number > 3 in Observations

Distance between players is taken at the beginning (or end) of a round: that is when
the zombies must calculate their next move. The end of round $i$ is the beginning of
round i+1. You could say the distance at round 0 is infinite, since they have not yet
chosen a position.

Clarify notation z^i_r as position of player begining of round r >= 1. R for round.

Add new declaration for Diameter operator of graph.

Can a survivor cause oscillation? Zombie and survivor hop back and forth
between two vertices indefinitely.

A zombie cannot stay in place. It must move.

Add zombie-win start positions to definitions.
