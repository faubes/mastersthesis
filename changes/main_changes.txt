-A variation of Cops and Robbers on Graphs called Zombies and Survivors was recently proposed and studied \cite{fitzpatrick2016deterministic, fitzpatrick2018game}.
-Z \& S is the same as Cops and Robbers with the added twist that the zombies are required to move closer to the survivor. We consider a deterministic version of the game in which zombies are assumed to apply an optimal strategy (initial position and move choices, if any). Chapter~\ref{chapter intro} summarizes important results in vertex-pursuit games. In Chapter~\ref{chapter planar zombies} we give an example of a planar graph where 3 zombies always lose, whereas Aigner and Fromme \cite{aigner1984game} showed that three robbers have a winning strategy on planar graphs.
+Cops and Robbers on Graphs (C \& R) is a vertex-to-vertex pursuit game played on graphs first introduced by Quilliot and Nowakowski \cite{quilliot1978jeux, nowakowski1983vertex}. The cop player starts the game by choosing a set of vertices which will be the cops' starting positions. The robber player responds by choosing its own start vertex. On each player's turn, the player may move one of its tokens from to an adjacent vertex. The cops win if the robber is captured (they occupy the same vertex). The robber wins if the robber can avoid capture indefinitely.
+A variation of C \& R  called Zombies and Survivors (Z \& S) was recently proposed and studied \cite{fitzpatrick2016deterministic, fitzpatrick2018game}.
+Z \& S is the same as C \& R with the added twist that the zombies are required to move closer to the survivor. In the deterministic version of Z \& S, the zombies are assumed to apply an optimal strategy (that is, they choose a winning start position and, whenever two shortest paths exist, make a winning move if such exists). Chapter~\ref{chapter intro} summarizes important results in vertex-pursuit games. In Chapter~\ref{chapter planar zombies} we give an example of a planar graph where 3 zombies always lose, whereas Aigner and Fromme \cite{aigner1984game} showed that three robbers have a winning strategy on planar graphs.
 In Chapter~\ref{chapter q_m_n} we show how two zombies can win on a cycle with one chord.
